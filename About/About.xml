--- Original Description ---
Overview

Rimoleum: synthetic flooring

Details

Rimoleum is a synthetic fire retardant flooring material that is quick to lay and affords some cleanliness. Great for areas like kitchens, food storage or any room where a combination of sanitary conditions and aesthetic appeal is desirable but not as crucial as say medical sanitary needs.

Rimoleum tiles are made using Chemfuel and Synthread combined in a bio-fuel reactor.

Mod Notes

Can be added to existing save games. To remove, you'd have to remove all related in game items and terrain.

Rimoleum tiles are categorised in their own sub section under manufactured items.
