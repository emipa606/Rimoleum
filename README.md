**The release of RimWorld 1.6 added improved support for [Asset Bundles](https://github.com/emipa606/AssetBuilder/blob/main/README.md).**
To avoid doubling the size of the mod, it was re-released using only Asset Bundles, you can find the new version of this mod [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3499058572).
This version will not receive any further updates.

# Overview
 V1.1

Rimoleum: synthetic flooring

# Details


Rimoleum is a synthetic fire retardant flooring material that is quick to lay and affords some cleanliness. Great for areas like kitchens, food storage or any room where a combination of sanitary conditions and aesthetic appeal is desirable but not as crucial as say medical sanitary needs.

Rimoleum tiles are made using Chemfuel and Synthread combined in a bio-fuel reactor.

# Mod Notes


Can be added to existing save games. To remove, you'd have to remove all related in game items and terrain.

Spacer Tech: Research project in own research tab.

Rimoleum tiles are categorised in their own sub section under manufactured items.

# Compatibility


RimPlas - will use RimRayon instead of Synthread, can also make the tiles in the injection moulder.
